DYDX can be utilized to participate in governance on the dYdX Chain, a fully decentralized, community governed platform. ethDYDX, a governance token for the dYdX v3 protocol, is undergoing a [migration](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-token-migration/start-here/introduction) to dYdX Chain DYDX. If you have ethDYDX and want to bridge your tokens to the dYdX Chain to unlock expanded DYDX functionalities, read this [how-to-bridge](https://www.dydx.foundation/how-to-bridge/overview) guide. For a detailed overview of the functionalities of dYdX Chain DYDX, read the dYdX Foundation’s [Token Mechanics](https://www.dydx.foundation/blog/dydx-token-mechanics) blog.",
